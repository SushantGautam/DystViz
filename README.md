## Outline:
Videos of patients from Dystonia Colatition is processed with OpenPose

The temporal displacement of the pose coordinates are plotted:

The temporal spatial displacement is fed to CNN along with the clinical score:

Difference in Model Score and Clinical Score showing that most of the scored are accurate as almost all difference is around zero.
